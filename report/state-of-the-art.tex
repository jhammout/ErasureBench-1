\subsection{XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure Codes for Big Data \autocite{XorbasVLDB}}

The article presents a new family of erasure codes called \acp{lrc}.
These codes enable local repair of faulty data.
It means that to repair a file, it is not needed to load all of its blocks, as is common with e.g. Reed-Solomon.
The authors implemented their algorithm in Hadoop HDFS and deployed a test to Facebook clusters.
The repair process of \ac{lrc} uses half the disk and network bandwidth compared to Reed-Solomon, at the expense of \SI{14}{\percent} more storage usage.
