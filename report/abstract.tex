\begin{abstract}
We present ErasureBench, a framework to test and benchmark erasure coding implementations for distributed storage systems under realistic conditions. ErasureBench automatically instantiates and scale a cluster of storage nodes, and can seamlessly leverage existing failure traces.
As a first example, we use ErasureBench to compare three coding implementations: a (10,4) Reed-Solomon code, a (10,6,5) locally repairable code, and a (10,0) code, i.e., a partition of the data source in ten pieces without error-correction.
\hm{Conclude main results. Will wait until the simulations are settled}
