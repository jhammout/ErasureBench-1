\hm{Should ``storage'' be in the title?} We present ErasureBench, a framework to test and compare erasure coding implementations for distributed storage under realistic conditions. \hm{Expand description.} As a first example, we use ErasureBench to compare three coding implementations: a partition of the data source in ten pieces without error-correction, a (14,10) Reed-Solomon code, and a (10,6,5) locally repairable code. \hm{Conclude}
