# Failure Trace Archive parser

This script parses the traces availble at http://fta.scem.uws.edu.au/. The traces need to be in SQLite format. They are [available here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4830384304EDF9F1!35182&authkey=!ABOHUGNL-7NbZas&ithint=file%2cbz2).

To use them, copy all *.db files under the databases directory.

A mirror of the files in _tabbed_ format is [available](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4830384304EDF9F1!35177&authkey=!AFTfA20ZU8lD4Ik&ithint=file%2cbz2).
