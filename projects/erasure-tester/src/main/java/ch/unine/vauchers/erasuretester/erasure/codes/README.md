# erasure.codes package

Classes in this package come from the [Hadoop tree of the University of Southern California](https://github.com/madiator/HadoopUSC/tree/developUSC/src/contrib/raid/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/raid). The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Our modifications consist in making the code free of any Hadoop dependency.
